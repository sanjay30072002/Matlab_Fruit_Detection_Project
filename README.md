# Matlab_Fruit_Detection_Project

Developed a MATLAB-based fruit detection system using HSV color segmentation and image processing techniques to identify and classify different fruits. Implemented RGB-HSV conversion, thresholding, and binary masking to enhance detection accuracy, demonstrating the application of computer vision in object recognition.
